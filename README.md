NLTK Chatbot
This project is a simple chatbot implemented using the NLTK library in Python. The chatbot uses pattern-response pairs to engage in basic conversations.
Features
•	Responds to greetings and common questions.
•	Provides information about its functionality and origin.
•	Allows users to exit the chat by typing "bye" or "quit."
•	Offers a default response for unrecognized inputs.
How It Works
The chatbot is built using NLTK's Chat module. Predefined patterns and responses are matched to the user's input using regular expressions.
Example Conversation
ChatBot: Hello! I am your friendly chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.  
User: Hi  
ChatBot: Hi there!  
User: What is your name?  
ChatBot: I am a chatbot created using NLTK.  
User: Bye  
ChatBot: Goodbye!
